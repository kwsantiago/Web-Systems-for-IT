    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/dedamescuracao/" target="_blank">De Dames</a> is a great place to eat for brunch. I personally love to eat bitterballen here but they have other great selections like pancakes and soups.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SilvaSnack/" target="_blank">Silva Snack</a> is a snackbar that has a lot of good treats like pastechis and bitterballen. People can stop by and pick up a snack that they can eat while on the road.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.kyotocuracao.com/" target="_blank">Kyoto</a> is a sushi restaurant that I love to go to, since they have authentic meals that are hard to beat on the island. There are also hibachi bars and other entrees such as beef with pasta that tastes very good.</li>
