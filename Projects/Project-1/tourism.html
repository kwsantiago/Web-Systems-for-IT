    <p>Tourism is one of the biggest industries in Curacao. At least 20% of the economy is contributed to by tourism. In the above table, you can see the amount of inbound toursists to the island. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism has fallen off and the economy has taken a large hit on the island. Regardless, this page showcases some data on the tourism on the island.</p>

    <p>The round fried balls here are called bitterballen. These are deep-fried balls of gooey beef and gravy and itâ€™s typically served with mustard for dipping.</p>

    <p>This is karni stoba, or beef stew in English. The beef stew, which can also be made with goat, is a dish of cubed, marinated meat simmered with different combinations of onions, garlic, cumin, curry, nutmeg, bell peppers and tomatoes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/dedamescuracao/" target="_blank">De Dames</a> is a great place to eat for brunch. I personally love to eat bitterballen here but they have other great selections like pancakes and soups.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SilvaSnack/" target="_blank">Silva Snack</a> is a snackbar that has a lot of good treats like pastechis and bitterballen. People can stop by and pick up a snack that they can eat while on the road.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.kyotocuracao.com/" target="_blank">Kyoto</a> is a sushi restaurant that I love to go to, since they have authentic meals that are hard to beat on the island. There are also hibachi bars and other entrees such as beef with pasta that tastes very good.</li>
